# Landing Page Project Description

The landing page is created using JavaScript, which allows me to add sections dynamically.

I wrote a function to generate links for each section.

I also made sure that the active section and its corresponding link stand out visually.

To make it user-friendly, I added a button for easily creating more sections.

Additionally, I included a scroll-to-top icon that only appears when the page is scrolled down beyond 800 pixels.

The header link disappears after 4 seconds of inactivity but reappears when the user starts scrolling again.
